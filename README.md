# **`llm-core-pipeline`**

**`llm-core-pipeline`** is a modular backend pipeline designed to power applications that leverage **large language models (LLMs)**. It provides essential components for building robust, scalable systems for tasks such as **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **semantic search**, and **document-based question answering**.

This repository abstracts the foundational layers of LLM workflows into clean, reusable modules — enabling rapid prototyping, experimentation, and production deployment.

## **🧩 Project Structure**

The repository is organized into four core functional modules:

- **`data_ingestion/`**
  - Responsible for **gathering raw data** from various sources (e.g., files, web, APIs).
  - Includes support for structured and unstructured formats (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, web scraping).
  - Designed to be extensible for new data sources.

- **`data_transformer/`**
  - Performs **cleaning**, **normalization**, and **chunking** of ingested data.
  - Can be used to split documents into semantically meaningful units.
  - Prepares data for vectorization while maintaining traceability to original content.

- **`embeddings/`**
  - Generates **vector representations** of transformed content.
  - Supports integration with local or hosted embedding models (e.g., **OpenAI**, **HuggingFace**, **DeepSeek**, etc.).
  - Embeddings are output in a format compatible with downstream vector stores.

- **`vectorstore/`**
  - Manages **storage**, **indexing**, and **querying** of embedding vectors.
  - Interfaces with vector databases such as **FAISS**, **Chroma**, or **Weaviate**.
  - Enables efficient semantic search and retrieval over embedded content.

## **🚀 Usage Overview**

Typical usage flow:

1. Use the **`data_ingestion/`** scripts to load or extract raw documents.
2. Clean and preprocess using **`data_transformer/`**, including chunking or tokenization.
3. Convert processed chunks into embeddings via **`embeddings/`**.
4. Store and query these vectors using **`vectorstore/`**, enabling retrieval for downstream tasks (e.g., LLM prompting, ranking, answering).

Each module is designed to work independently or as part of a full pipeline. You can run the steps modularly or orchestrate them with a pipeline manager like **LangChain**, **LLMFlow**, or **custom Python scripts**.
